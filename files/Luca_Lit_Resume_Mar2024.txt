## SUMMARY:

I'm a graduate from Dartmouth College with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Currently working as a ML Infrastructure + DevOps (MLOps) engineer at Appian Corporation, building a high performance platform to train and deploy custom ML Models in a rapid and scalable manner. My passions lie in software engineering and project management for socially impactful endeavors. Some apps I've built:
StoryCloud: a social media app to record and share your life stories with family and friends.
Fryday: an AI-powered recipe sharing platform that enables chefs to instantly turn cooking videos into full recipes.

## WORK EXPERIENCE:

1. Point72 Ventures (Venture Capital Fund) 
Data Engineer (Full Stack) 
Jul 2024 – Present
- PeopleGPT Lite: Built an AI-powered search engine for top founder talent and startups. Optimized ingestion of 2M+
LinkedIn profiles into a VectorDB using multi-processing, and implemented RAG to enable natural language querying
with sub-second latency. Achieved cost savings of $7,500/month by replacing a 3rd party SaaS tool.
- Network Leads Gen: Engineered a fully-automated leads generation system in Python, running ETL pipelines out of Apache
Airflow, with S3 as data lake, and PostgreSQL DB as data warehouse. Processed 3000+ Twitter and LinkedIn profiles /
week, exceeding network meeting goals by 22%, increasing new contacts by >70%, & boosting deal flows by 30%.
- Pre-Meeting Notes: Built a microservice in Python to automate research on people and companies, ingesting millions of
profiles from PeopleDataLabs and Affinity into PostgreSQL DB. Designed caching layers and optimized SQL queries to
reduce data retrieval to sub-second latency. Integrated the tool with Outlook Calendar using Microsoft Graph API,
generating over 1000+ investor meeting notes/month for the VC team, eliminating all manual research efforts.
- Smart Leads: Developed a Slackbot to notify investors of new startup and stealth company leads on a daily basis, with
AI-generated outreach emails ready-to-send with a button press. Deployed event listeners using WebSockets, leveraging
Celery + Redis as a queueing system to support processing of concurrent message interactions for 50+ users.
- MWAA on EKS: Migrated MWAA (Airflow) jobs from AWS Fargate, to Kubernetes pods managed by EKS, addressing a key
limitation in Fargate’s CPU/storage management causing frequent MWAA crashes. Enabled isolated task execution
environments, improved reliability for critical workflows, and reduced operational costs by $1,000 /month.
- CRM Sync: Implemented a robust pipeline to ingest data on 100,000+ organizations, 150,000+ people, and 15,000+ deal
pipelines from Attio CRM into a PostgreSQL, optimized with multi-processing for parallel API calls and exponential
backoff for retries. Set up a public webhook with AWS Lambda to enable real-time updates to the internal DB, enabling
SQL-powered querying, custom data enrichments, and personalized dashboards for deal flow monitoring.

2. Appian Corporation (Low-Code Software Enterprise)
Software Engineer II (MLOps)
Sep 2021 - Jun 2024
- Built & maintained a FastAPI application in Python to support custom machine learning model training and deployment.
Delivered feature in <1 year, onboarding 20+ new enterprise customers, increasing Appian software adoption by 10%.
- Implemented 30+ unit & integration tested endpoints for uploading datasets & running ML model training +inference.
Containerized the app using Docker, and deployed it using ArgoCD. Provisioned and managed Gitlab pipelines to
automate CI/CD, setup a monitoring and alerts system using Prometheus, and added Jaeger tracing to backend services.
- Optimized file upload by parallelizing calls to AWS S3, reducing latency for 200 concurrent file uploads - from 10 to 5s.
- Reduced inference completion time by 85%, by migrating AWS Batch Transform to Kubernetes jobs.
- Reduced API latency for training + inference endpoints by 70%, by implementing an asynchronous processing system
using 1) AWS SQS to queue tasks and 2) K8s Operators to autoscale jobs for processing those compute-intensive tasks.
- Also owned end-to-end implementation of a file retention system using the same queueing mechanism.
- Provisioned AWS cloud services backing the API’s persistent metadata storage, secure file storage and ML model
training using Terraform (i.e. DynamoDB, S3, KMS, Sagemaker, SQS). Created scheduled Gitlab CI pipelines to
clean up unused AWS resources, reducing company costs by $8700 / month.

3. Keystone Strategy (Strategy & Tech Consulting Firm)
Data Science Intern
Jun 2021 – Sep 2021
- Pre-processed 170,000+ rows of customer service data using numpy + pandas, and trained a deep learning NLP model
to outperform a formerly employed 3rd party software, increasing prediction accuracy from 89% to 98.6%.
- Trained proprietary ML model to predict precise repair solutions to defected home appliances using textual data (~ 800
lines of Python code). Increased company valuation by ~ 30%, to $200 million, in preparation for M&A considerations.

4. Harmonize (HR Management Software Startup)
Data Science Intern
Jul 2020 – Sep 2020
- Developed a logistic regression model to forecast customer churn using Python and SQL. Devised renewal strategies for
the marketing team using customer segmentation analysis. Increased retention rate by ~20% in the subsequent year.
- Automated a script using Selenium to scrape product reviews from review platforms, reporting 20+ bugs and defects.
