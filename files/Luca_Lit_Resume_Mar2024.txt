WORK EXPERIENCE
Appian Corporation (Low-Code Software Enterprise)
Software Engineer II (MLOps)

Sep 2021 - Current

Built & maintained a FastAPI application in Python to support custom machine learning model training and deployment.
Delivered feature in <1 year, onboarding 20+ new enterprise customers, increasing Appian software adoption by 10%.
Implemented 30+ unit & integration tested endpoints for uploading datasets & running ML model training +inference.
Containerized the app using Docker, and deployed it using ArgoCD. Provisioned and managed Gitlab pipelines to
automate CI/CD, setup a monitoring and alerts system using Prometheus, and added Jaeger tracing to backend services.
Optimized file upload by parallelizing calls to AWS S3, reducing latency for 200 concurrent file uploads - from 10 to 5s.
Reduced inference completion time by 85%, by migrating AWS Batch Transform to Kubernetes jobs.
Reduced API latency for training + inference endpoints by 70%, by implementing an asynchronous processing system
using 1) AWS SQS to queue tasks and 2) K8s Operators to autoscale jobs for processing those compute-intensive tasks.
Also owned end-to-end implementation of a file retention system using the same queueing mechanism.
Provisioned AWS cloud services backing the API’s persistent metadata storage, secure file storage and ML model
training using Terraform (i.e. DynamoDB, S3, KMS, Sagemaker, SQS). Created scheduled Gitlab CI pipelines to
clean up unused AWS resources, reducing company costs by $8700 / month.

Keystone Strategy (Strategy & Tech Consulting Firm)
Data Science Intern

Jun 2021 – Sep 2021

Pre-processed 170,000+ rows of customer service data using numpy + pandas, and trained a deep learning NLP model
to outperform a formerly employed 3rd party software, increasing prediction accuracy from 89% to 98.6%.
Trained proprietary ML model to predict precise repair solutions to defected home appliances using textual data (~ 800
lines of Python code). Increased company valuation by ~ 30%, to $200 million, in preparation for M&A considerations.

Harmonize (HR Management Software Startup)
Data Science Intern
Jul 2020 – Sep 2020

Developed a logistic regression model to forecast customer churn using Python and SQL. Devised renewal strategies for
the marketing team using customer segmentation analysis. Increased retention rate by ~20% in the subsequent year.
Automated a script using Selenium to scrape product reviews from review platforms, reporting 20+ bugs and defects.
Worked with engineering team to enhance automated chatbot features, boosting product adoption by 22% in 3 months.
